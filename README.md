### Description

This is a great button control if you want to build professional-looking applications. It provides 6 different styles, including a Cool (Rebar) style, flat, standard (3D) and 2 different Options styles. Allows for different pictures, colors and fonts in all 3 states -- normal, hover and selected. Has all the other properties of a standard button, so it is a great replacement.  12/21 -- added Cancel and Default properties.

**Feedback is greatly appreciated**
 
### More Info
 
This wasn't initally intended for distribution, so the comments aren't so great.

This button is a much-expanded version of the SoftButton control, which is a downloadable example from the MS website. Same core drawing, tooltip, etc. code, but with a lot of extended capabilities.
